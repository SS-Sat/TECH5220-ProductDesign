# TECH 5220 **Visual and Interaction Design for Digital Products**

This course introduces students to the concepts, methods, techniques, and theory of visual design in the context of creating digital products. Students will analyze examples, past and present, of form in relationship to content on web and mobile. From there, they will learn and practice basic principles for typography, color, and composition through prototyping, visual iteration, and critique. Brand elements, UX principles, accessibility, user research, and pattern libraries will be discussed.

*You will not be a full-fledged, "full-stack" digital product designer at the conclusion of this five-week course.* You will, however, understand better how and why we should care about how people experience our products, and how seemingly arbitrary design decisions are in fact *not* arbitrary, and have consequences. We will be both working at the micro-scale (typography, color, form) and at the macro-scale (design patterns, accessibility, ethics) towards this understanding. You will understand better what makes a good designer, so that you’re not just relying on job titles to figure out who knows what. We will also work towards habits of seeing and of critique that will make you a better collaborator with other disciplines.


*By the end of this course, students will be able to:*

– Contextualize digital product design within the history and current state of a broader range of design practices

– Appreciate and articulate the importance of brand identity and design systems in the making of digital products  

– Assess and articulate good and bad design practices in terms of user experience, accessibility, and ethics

– Practice basic design principles for typography, color, composition, and user flows using contemporary prototyping tools


*Student responsibilities:*

– Come to all classes ready to engage and give feedback

– Complete readings and assignments (to be added to a shared artifacts sheet)

– As with Product studio, absolutely no use of digital devices in class, except for in-class exercises


*Grading:*

– In-class exercises: 20%

– Out-of-class exercises: 60%

– Final prototype: 20%

*Schedule:*

*Note: This is the first time that this class is being offered here. Content, assignments, and pace are all subject to change based on feedback.*

*Software and tools:*

Design software in general and prototyping software in particular is a changing, and contested space. The current standard is a **Sketch** and **Invision** workflow, using Sketch to create visual systems and Invision to prototype interactions. **Figma** and **Framer** is a newer workflow, and is rapidly catching up in popularity.  

What’s the difference? Sketch works offline and has a number of plugins, some of which allow the use of real data; Invision has a crazy easy learning curve. But Figma has a couple of (big) advantages: it’s browser-based, so *you don’t need a Mac,* and you can work on the same file with people simultaneously. But you always have to be connected to the internet, and there are no text styles (there is a workaround). Prototyping within Figma is limited, and while it has the Framer integration, Framer is code-based and so the learning curve is steeper. To add to the dilemma, there are a dozen other prototyping tools, all of which have their ups and downs.  

But for now I’m going to recommend that you either:

A) Download Sketch and Invision. Sketch is 50% off for students, InVision is free for us.

or

B) Sign up for Figma and download Framer. Figma is free and Framer is 50% off for students.

If you are on a PC, this is already decided for you (B), but if you’re on a Mac, decide what you would like to spend your time on learning. I am working on getting us licenses for Framer, and you can find information on discounts for Sketch, Invision, and Figma here:
